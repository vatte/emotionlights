# Lighting up the worlds emotions

Lights follow tweets about emotions w/ colours on a spiral. #emotionhack, #ehd2016 and @emotionhackday go party mode!

## Inspiration

I had christmas lights which needed an update to support JSON.

## What it does

Visualizes the worlds emotions! 6 Basic emotions mapped to different colours and special emotion hack day keywords to activate party mode.

## How I built it

Twitter Stream API with node.js/raspberry pi connected to Arduino driving a LPD6803 RGB LED strip.

## Challenges I ran into

Broken jumper cable and picking the wrong serial port.

## What's next

Full EmotionML support for choosing which emotion model to track.
